-- Listing 5-1: Basic addition, subtraction and multiplication with SQL

SELECT 2 + 2;    -- addition
SELECT 9 - 1;    -- subtraction
SELECT 3 * 4;    -- multiplication

-- Listing 5-2: Integer and decimal division with SQL

SELECT 11 / 6;   -- integer division
SELECT 11 % 6;   -- modulo division
SELECT 11.0 / 6; -- decimal division

-- Listing 5-3: Exponents, roots and factorials with SQL

SELECT 3 ^ 4;    -- exponentiation
SELECT |/ 10;    -- square root (operator)
SELECT sqrt(10); -- square root (function)
SELECT ||/ 10;   -- cube root
SELECT 4 !;      -- factorial

-- Order of operations

SELECT 7 + 8 * 9; 	-- answer: 79
SELECT (7 + 8) * 9;	-- answer: 135

SELECT 3 ^ 3 - 1;   -- answer: 26
SELECT 3 ^ (3 - 1); -- answer: 9
